/*
 * v1.10.24 — Client credit balance from overpayments.
 *
 * Reported: "this extra payment can be added to the next bill of
 * customer, u enabled that — auto or manual."
 *
 * Design.
 * When a client pays more than the invoice total on Bill A, the excess
 * sits as an overpayment on Bill A. When Bill B is later created for
 * the same client, we let the user "apply" that credit — accounting is
 * a dual-entry transfer:
 *
 *   Bill A gets an extra payment entry `{amount: -X, mode:
 *     'credit-transferred-out', creditTargetBillId: <new bill id>}` so
 *     Bill A's outstanding stops showing overpaid.
 *   Bill B gets `{amount: +X, mode: 'credit-applied', creditSourceBillIds:
 *     [source ids]}` so Bill B's outstanding drops by X and the
 *     application is auditable.
 *
 * The two entries net to zero (no new cash), so total-paid-vs-invoiced
 * for the client is unchanged.
